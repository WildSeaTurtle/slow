Fibonacci numbers using both recursive
and fast iterative methods. It prints the calculated Fibonacci numbers and the time
taken for each calculation.

The main method calculates and prints Fibonacci numbers using both recursive and fast iterative methods for a range of values.


Calculates the Fibonacci number recursively.
Calculates the Fibonacci number using a fast iterative method.



@param i The index of the Fibonacci number to calculate
@return The calculated Fibonacci number
